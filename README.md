## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Davey, I'm a systems programmer and C/C++ developer/software engineer out at Atlas School of Tulsa. I specialize in low level development and systems development for linux, and I also have experience in web and OOP. When it comes to programming, I live by the motto: "I just wanna make cool stuff"! I'm both a working professional in the Aerospace field and a Veteran of the USAF. In my free time I perform as part of several improv troupes, I cook, and I play games.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MEGADRIVE, our bundled game launcher with over 100\* games!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the finer points of C++ and project development, and I'm learning AGILE/LEAN principles at work and on my own.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about memory, how a program becomes a process, how ELF files are laid out, or about horror movies!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveyhaysiii/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: any/all (they/them, he/him, she/her, whatever you're comfortable with!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've bought more concert tickets this year than the entire rest of my life
